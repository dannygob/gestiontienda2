The following directories (and all their contents) should be deleted from the `app/` directory:

app/data/
app/di/
app/domain/
app/presentation/

Reasoning: These directories contain a duplicated and mostly outdated version of the application code, which is correctly located and maintained under `app/src/main/java/com/example/gestiontienda2/`. Keeping them would cause confusion and potential build issues if accidentally included in source sets.

Files that were identified as potentially useful from these directories (specific ViewModels) have already been moved to the `app/src/main/java/com/example/gestiontienda2/` structure.
Additionally, the file `app/src/main/java/com/example/gestiontienda2/data/repository/ProductRepository.kt` should be deleted as it was found to be a misplaced and redundant Room setup. (This is separate from the directories above).
